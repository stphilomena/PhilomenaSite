                        <h4>A Saint Beloved by the Church</h4>
                        <p>She is a saint like no other: the only person in history “recognized as a saint solely on the
                            basis of her intercessory miracles.” Unlike other saints, there was no written historical
                            record of her life when she was raised to the altar of the Church. This hints at her special
                            mission, some of which has been revealed to us, as we will see, but which has still yet to
                            completely unfold. Thus far it has done so brilliantly, in both her secret intercessions for
                            souls and her astonishing public miracles, which have earned her the name “Great
                            Wonderworker of the Nineteenth Century.”
                            Despite her abundant and awesome miracles, confusion and doubt has arisen in recent decades
                            because of the 1961 Congregation of Rites decision to remove her feast from the liturgical
                            calendar, giving way to questions such as: Is Saint Philomena really a saint? Did she even
                            exist?
                            The faithful can rest assured that this decision in no way calls into question her existence
                            or sainthood. On the contrary! Saint Philomena’s sainthood has been consistently affirmed by
                            the highest authority of the Church, with nineteen acts by five popes promoting devotion to
                            St. Philomena! Still today, devotion at her Mugnano shrine is practiced with the full
                            approval of the Holy See.
                            Those who doubt the legitimacy of her devotion should consider what Pope Pius X said about
                            his decision to raise the Venerable Archconfraternity of Saint Philomena to the status of
                            Universal Archconfraternity. This confirmed the legitimacy of devotion to Saint Philomena.
                            In the Apostolic Brief <em>Pias Fidelium Societates</em>, he solemnly stated: ". . . to
                            discredit the present decisions and declarations concerning Saint Philomena as not being
                            permanent, stable, valid and effective, necessary of obedience, and in full effect for all
                            eternity, proceeds from an element that is null and void and without merit or authority."
                            One could say that Pope Pius X had the final say on Saint Philomena!</p>

                        <h4>Great Wonderworker of the Nineteenth Century</h4>
                        What was at first lacking in historical knowledge about Saint Philomena’s life would be made up
                        for with an outpouring of miracles, which were so numerous and remarkable that by the
                        mid-1800’s, the faithful were clamoring to have her made a saint.
                        When the body of Saint Philomena was discovered in an underground cemetery in 1802, it was
                        immediately apparent that she was no ordinary girl. Her marble coffin displayed special emblems:
                        a palm frond representing the victory of martyrdom, and an anchor as well as two criss-crossed
                        arrows to show the afflictions she endured. A lily represented virginity. Three marble tiles
                        sealed her tomb, which were found to read (when correctly arranged): <em>Pax Tecum
                        Filumena</em> - Peace be to you, Philomena!
                        The full extent of this little martyr’s identity remained, for the time being, a mystery. But
                        God’s manifestation of her sanctity came quickly and splendidly: As those excavating her tomb
                        transferred her encased dried blood particles to another vase for examination, they were
                        astonished to find these particles had transformed into what appeared to be glittering gems of
                        emerald, ruby, diamond, gold and silver! Luigi Cardinal Ruffo Scilla testified to this miracle
                        in his solemn deposition.<br/>

                           rel="nofollow">See Sr. Marie Helen Mohr’s book &gt;</a>
                        <p>This wonder was only the first of innumerable miracles, of which here
                            is mentioned only a tiny fraction. The miraculous multiplication of her bone dust, the
                            mysterious re-painting of a botched paper-maiche statue made (or rather, attempted) in her
                            likeness, and the sealing of a cracked marble altar created in her honor were all among her
                            first miracles officially confirmed by the Church. She continues to work miracles and
                            intercede for souls today, with her most momentous miracles being those of grace.</p>

                        <h4>Raised to the Altar of the Church</h4>
                        <p>The decisive miracle that would raise Saint Philomena to the altar of the Church was to come
                            through another holy woman, Venerable Pauline Marie Jaricot, foundress of what would become
                            the Vatican Congregation Propaganda Fidei. Stricken with a grave illness while only in her
                            30’s, Pauline decided to seek Saint Philomena’s intercession for healing by embarking upon a
                            pilgrimage to her shrine in Mugano, Italy. On the way, she stopped in Rome to ask the Holy
                            Father to formally approve public devotion to Philomena if she returned to him cured after
                            visiting the shrine in Mugnano. This he agreed to, because she appeared so near death that
                            the Pope had no expectation that she would ever return.
                            Pauline arrived to Mugnano resigned to the will of God, but many townspeople, seeing her so
                            ill that she looked more like a corpse than a living person, implored Saint Philomena for
                            Pauline’s healing. During her third evening in church on August 10, Pauline began to
                            experience her miraculous cure during the blessing of the Most Holy Sacrament.</p>
                        When Pauline returned to Rome to visit Pope Gregory XVI, he requested that she stay in Rome a
                        year so that he could verify her miraculous healing, and deliver his promise. And so he did: in
                        1837, he solemnly confirmed her public veneration and bestowed a Mass in her honor.

            <h2>The Life and Martyrdom of Saint Philomena</h2>
            <p>Just who was this saint, so young yet so powerful in her intercession? To tell Saint Philomena’s story,
                we have something even better than historical record: we have the vivid and captivating details of her
                martyrdom from the saint herself, given by locution to three different Italians, unknown to each
                other.</p>
            <p>Of the locutions received, those given to Sr. Luisa di Gesu in 1833, which have been approved by the Holy
                Office (presently the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith), are most well known. You can read the
                story of Saint Philomena’s martyrdom here.</p>

            <h4>A Saint with a Special Mission: Why We Need Saint Philomena</h4>
            <p>Saint Philomena’s name, taken from the original Filumena, which means “daughter of light,” expresses her
                divine mission as a shining beacon of holiness, a kind of “lighthouse” pointing towards God, and giving
                a practical example by which we can properly orient our life and form our hearts.</p>
            <p>Her virtue sparkles like a diamond, in all its strength and splendor, in her heroic martyrdom. She
                renounced her self totally: not only forgoing wealth, fame, honor and pleasure, but a long and “full”
                life and the approval of her family, while suffering all of the pains of her martyrdom. To endure this
                is only made possible by profound faith in God and His Almighty, loving Providence; by hope in His
                promises; and by a pure and ardent love for Him, the kind of love that from ones depths recognizes and
                loves God as All.</p>
            <p>This love is what conquers self-love. It is the cornerstone of Saint Philomena’s purity, strength, and
                all of her virtue. It is the kind of love that will overcome our own temptations, especially that of
                impurity. Saint Philomena, who consecrated her life and virginity to God, and who herself overcame
                temptation, will intercede for our own purity of heart, mind and body if we ask humbly, persistently,
                and with faith.</p>
            <p>Besides beckoning all souls to purity, God emphasizes the extremely precious value of consecrated
                virginity through saints like Philomena, who earn their crown of martyrdom in defense of this gift to
                God. Through the example of St. Philomena, God beckons souls to answer His call and likewise consecrate
                themselves fully to Him out of love.</p>

            <h4>Role Model for Youth</h4>
            <p>Saint Philomena died at age 13, an age during which many young people lose an innocence of soul. Let us
                pray for her intercession especially for our teens and youth, who are assaulted with more temptations
                than any generation of history. As parents, let us hold her up as a true heroine and role model for our
                children. Her story, which reveals her humanity as well as her virtue, offers so many lessons, not the
                least of which is the necessity of assiduous prayer and total dependence upon God. This must be
                emphasized when cultivating purity in our youth, which is a difficult task, but an invaluable one. It is
                in great part our youth’s determination to preserve their purity that will lay the foundations of a
                virtuous and stable society.</p>
            <p>Let us also speak of the wondrous miracles God wrought in Saint Philomena’s martyrdom and of the glorious
                place she holds in heaven, as revealed by her intercessory miracles, to provide an alternative to the
                glory of the world which is already constantly displayed in enticing color to our youth.</p>
            <h4>New Light of the Church Militant</h4>
            <p>The miraculous manner in which God revealed Saint Philomena - through both her intercessory miracles, and
                the locutions given about her life - appears to be a Providential response to the rationalist
                “Enlightenment” period which immediately preceded the discovery of Saint Philomena. It was - and still
                is - a timely and humbling reminder to men, puffed up with pride in our intellect, that we cannot know
                everything through our own power.</p>
            <p>Thus, her name which means “daughter of light,” and Saint John Vianney’s name for her - “new light of the
                Church militant” - have an added layer of meaning. While the so-called Enlightenment period in reality
                constituted a darkening of men’s intellects as they pulled away from God, Saint Philomena is an antidote
                to the Enlightenment, a true light reflecting the Light of Almighty God and pointing souls back towards
                Him. She reminds souls that God is the source of all knowledge and wisdom, to re-enkindle supernatural
                faith.</p>
            <p>As Cornelia Ferreira puts it so aptly:</p>
            <p>It does seem that God reserved St. Philomena as a remedy for our corrupt times...she has been sent to
                guide us away from the darkness of naturalism and materialism to the supernatural light of the Fire of
                Divine Love which she enkindles within souls. Further, through the power of her intercession, which is
                so great that she could be considered the Patron Saint of everything, she gives hope and faith in God to
                souls surrounded by the despair of atheism and a world descending into barbarism. No wonder this great
                light, like Our Lady of Fatima, had to be suppressed by the forces of Organized Naturalism that finally
                gained control over the Church in the 1960s. [Unknown Object]</p>

            <h4>Beacon of Hope</h4>
            <p>Saint Philomena, in her victory over temptation and of her martyrdom, is an especially powerful beacon of
                hope for us in our own struggles because of her very littleness. As a young girl who was barely a
                teenager, it is all the clearer to us that to endure her martyrdom, she could not rely on her own
                strength, but needed constant recourse to God. In reality, this is how every human being must conquer
                temptation, but because of our lack of humility, we must be reminded of our need to constantly pray for
                help.</p>
            <p>We need this encouragement not only in our ordinary struggles, but for our more difficult trials, even
                for a “white” martyrdom or bloody martyrdom. God desires that we fix our eyes upon Him alone, and upon
                eternity, as Saint Philomena did, because it is in this way that we too will emerge from this life
                victorious.</p>
